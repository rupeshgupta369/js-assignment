    <title>Question 7</title>
    <h4>An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything
    except 1 and itself.
    In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.
    <p>For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.</p>
    <p>Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.</p>
    <p>For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.</p>
    <p>P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value<p>
