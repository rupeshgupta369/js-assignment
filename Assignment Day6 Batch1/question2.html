    <p>Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi
        Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who
        seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.
        The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen
        years, and the second in his teens.The series is based on two
        one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto
        an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the
        following year, and Naruto (1997).Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to
        2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes.
        The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by
        Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002
        to 2007; the English adaptation of the series aired on Cartoon
        Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to
        the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017,
        after 500 episodes. The English adaptation was broadcast on Disney XD
        from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched
        over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014,
        starting over from the first episode. The English adaptation is still
        airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Besides the anime series,
        Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve original video
        animations (OVAs).</p>
